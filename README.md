# Welcome to ConnectPeople
ConnectPeople is a App which lets people connect with their friends online and chat with them without any hassle.
Whether you need to chat with your friend privately or group chat with several friends, ConnectPeople is for you.

# Motivation
Presently there is no webapp available which lets people chats with an easy interface and login/signup process.
ConnectPeople app just asks for your email id, username and password and let you Connect with your friends.
Moreover through this webapp, I am learning and gaining experience in Django.
